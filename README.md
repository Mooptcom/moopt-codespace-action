Meteor blaze app (PWA ready) to leverage github desktop, codespaces & actions

## What I built
An open platform (software and hardware) for decentralized urban farming.  

### Category Submission:
1. DIY Deployments: An automation workflows for application deployment, i.e. setup environment, testing and running at http://localhost:3000 (nodejs, meteorjs, blazejs, PWA ready, ... etc), using Github Codespaces.
2. Phone Friendly: The deployment is automatically and immediatelly ready for Progressive Web App (PWA), that are also available as mobile applications that work on both iOS and Android devices. 
3. Interesting IoT: Manage and monitor IoT devices, including tasks like managing configurations, updating firmware, and collecting and analyzing data.
